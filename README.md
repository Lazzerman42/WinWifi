# WinWifi
Simple c# NET 4.7 Winform App that shows info about which Wifi AP the computer is connected to.
Good for checking mesh-wifi-networks or just a multi AP setup.

Program can live in the traybar and activate when AP-change is detected

I use the ManagedWifi Nuget-package and the .NET network-components to get all info.
